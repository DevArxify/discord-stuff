# Important

Nothing shown here is against the [TOS](https://discord.com/terms) and you don't need to use any client modification.

## 1 - Discord's Color Schemes

Let's start with a new feature, the color schemes. As you can see in the demo, this says 'Staff Only', so probably it's not going to be released anytime soon. If you want to check it out, here's a demo. (sorry for the bad quality & shitty framerate lol)<br><br>

## 2 - Discord Profile Decorations

I saw these on one of [No Text To Speech](https://youtube.com/notexttospeech)'s videos, and I tried it out. This is only available for Nitro Boost subscribers, so I couldn't try it at all because I have a Nitro Basic subscription. Here's a demo.<br><br>

## 3 - Weird login bug

If you have the Color Schemes feature enabled, go to the 'Appearance' tab on your settings, and press ALT + left arrow key, you'll be taken to a weird bug which seems to be related to Discord's login page. It doesn't actually log you out, but it's fun to try. Here's a demo.<br><br>

## 4 - New 'Clips' Feature

It seems like this beta feature doesn't have any code linked to it, because when you open it, it just crashes your Discord client. Here's a demo.<br><br>

## 5 - Pronouns

This seems to be coming up soon, as it's fully coded. The only thing is that you can't save it (not yet). Here's a demo.<br><br>

## 6 - AutoMod in non-community servers

There's an experimental feature in which you can add AutoMod to your server without it being a community. Here's a demo.<br><br>

## 7 - Onboarding

This feature is right now only available for a small amount of servers. This will come out soon to the public. Here's a demo.<br><br>

Happy hunting!
